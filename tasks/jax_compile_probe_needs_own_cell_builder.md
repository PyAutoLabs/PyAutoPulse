The original task below is retained verbatim. Current scheduling state lives in `campaigns.yaml`; historical `Status` and paths below are provenance, not a second queue. Resolve old Mind paths through `migration.yaml`.

## Check-in 2026-10-04

- VERIFIED: autolens_profiling#245 closed 2026-09-11; [`scripts/misc/jax_compile/probe.py`](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_profiling/blob/a93f37a7ade16fcb7673a7777dfde505183728ed/scripts/misc/jax_compile/probe.py) still present on main. The Mind source draft was removed in Mind `dbbe5b22` (2026-10-03, move to Pulse); it is not in Mind complete/ or active.md, so this file is the live record.
- Unverified: whether the probe currently runs (not executed).
- Next: select one bounded step when prioritised.

# jax_compile/probe.py lost its cell builder with the searches tier — give profiling its own

Witness: `python scripts/misc/jax_compile/probe.py --cell <one pinned cell>` runs end to end and reproduces that cell's pinned warm-compile record within its tolerance

`scripts/misc/jax_compile/probe.py` built its cells through `searches._setup.build_for_cell`
(a 2,159-line module of the retired inference programme). autolens_profiling#245 removed
that tier (archived as PyAutoGut ref `archive/condemned/autolens-profiling/inference-programme`
@ `c8b60580`); `build_objective` now raises `NotImplementedError` naming the ref, so the
probe cannot run. Its pinned warm-compile records and the compile dashboard are intact.

Give the probe a builder this repo owns: the runtime/breakdown scripts already construct
every pinned cell (`_production_config.preset_for` + the per-cell model code in
`scripts/imaging/likelihood_runtime/*.py`), so factor the cell construction they share
into a small `scripts/misc/cells.py` (or reuse an existing helper if one exists — survey
first) and point `build_objective` at it. Do not restore anything from the archive ref.
Re-run the probe on every pinned cell and confirm the records still match.

Filed at the close of #245 (scrap-inference-programme); see
`complete/2026/09/autolens-inference-birth.md` for the epic.

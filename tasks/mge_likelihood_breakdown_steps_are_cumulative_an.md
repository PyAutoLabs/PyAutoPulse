Migrated-at: 2026-10-03

The original task below is retained verbatim. Current scheduling state lives in `campaigns.yaml`; historical `Status` and paths below are provenance, not a second queue. Resolve old Mind paths through `migration.yaml`.

## Check-in 2026-10-04

- VERIFIED: no GitHub refs; no change since the pin. The Mind source draft was removed in Mind `dbbe5b22` (2026-10-03, move to Pulse); it is not in Mind complete/ or active.md, so this file is the live record.
- Next: select one bounded step when prioritised.

# MGE likelihood_breakdown steps are cumulative and `linear_gaussians` is reported as 0

Type: bug
Target: workspaces
Repos:
- autolens_profiling
Difficulty: medium
Autonomy: safe
Priority: low
Memory: wiki/galaxies/sources/massive-ellipticals.md; wiki/lensing/sources/dark-matter-substructure.md; reading-queue.md
Status: formalised
Consequence: glance
Witness: After the fix, `likelihood_breakdown/mge.py` on the HST cell writes a JSON whose step timings sum to within 15% of the fused `likelihood_runtime/mge.py` single-call time (currently 40 ms vs 29.6 ms), and `configuration.linear_gaussians` equals the number of linear Gaussians inside the Basis objects (40 for the profiling cell), in both breakdown and runtime JSONs.

# MGE likelihood_breakdown steps are cumulative and `linear_gaussians` is reported as 0

Type: bug
Priority: low

Found in the 2026-09-24 MGE likelihood audit.

1. `scripts/imaging/likelihood_breakdown/mge.py`: step 2 (`mapping_matrix_from_params`, ~:418) re-runs the ray-trace and step 3 (`blurred_mm_from_params`, ~:462) rebuilds steps 1-2, so the per-step timings are cumulative and `total_step_by_step` double-counts. The published `mge_breakdown_hst_v2026.8.17.1.json` says 40.3 ms; the fused runtime is ~29.6 ms, and the real step-sum is ~29 ms (blurred 25.6 + D/F/NNLS/image/chi2 3.4). The A100 `mge_hpc_a100_fd64.json` total 7.8 ms is really ~6.5 ms, which makes NNLS ~44% of an A100 evaluation, not 36%. Check whether the other breakdown scripts (pixelization.py, delaunay*.py, fixed_light*.py) share the pattern before fixing only mge.py.
2. `tracer.cls_list_from(cls=al.lp_linear.LightProfileLinear)` (breakdown/mge.py ~:311, likelihood_runtime/mge.py ~:332) does not look inside an MGE `Basis`, so both scripts write `configuration.linear_gaussians: 0`; the real counts are 40 (profiling cell). Count the linear profiles inside each Basis.
3. Fix both, regenerate the affected result JSONs/PNGs and the README dashboards (`build_readme.py --check` gates lint), and note in the JSON/README that pre-fix breakdown totals are cumulative and not comparable.
